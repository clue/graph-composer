# clue/graph-composer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clue/graph-composer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clue/graph-composer)

Graph visualization for your project's `composer.json` and its dependencies:


![example dependency graph for clue/graph-composer](http://www.lueck.tv/graph-composer/graph-composer.png)

## Usage

Once clue/graph-composer is [installed](#install), you can use it via command line like this.

### graph-composer show

The `show` command creates a dependency graph for the given project path and opens
the default desktop image viewer for you:

```bash
$ php graph-composer.phar show ~/path/to/your/project
```

*   It accepts an optional argument which is the path to your project directory or composer.json file
    (defaults to checking the current directory for a composer.json file).

*   You may optionally pass an `--format=[svg/svgz/png/jpeg/...]` option to set
    the image type (defaults to `svg`).

### graph-composer export

The `export` command works very much like the `show` command, but instead of opening your
default image viewer, it will write the resulting graph into an image file:

```bash
$ php graph-composer.phar export ~/path/to/your/project
```

*   It accepts an optional argument which is the path to your project directory or composer.json file
    (defaults to checking the current directory for a composer.json file).

*   It accepts an additional optional argument which is the path to write the resulting image to.
    If this argument is not given, it defaults to writing to *projectname*.svg. Its file extension
    also sets the image format (unless you also explicitly pass the `--format` option). Example call:

    ```bash
    $ php graph-composer.phar export ~/path/to/your/project export.png
    ```
    
*   You may optionally pass an `--format=[svg/svgz/png/jpeg/...]` option to set
    the image type (defaults to `svg`).

## Install

You can grab a copy of clue/graph-composer in either of the following ways.

### As a phar (recommended)

You can simply download a pre-compiled and ready-to-use version as a Phar
to any directory:

```bash
$ wget http://www.lueck.tv/graph-composer/graph-composer.phar
```

Additionally, you'll have to install GraphViz (`dot` executable).
Users of Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions may simply invoke:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

Windows users have to [download GraphViZ for Windows](http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php) and remaining
users should install from [GraphViz homepage](http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php).


> If you prefer a global (system-wide) installation without having to type the `.phar` extension
each time, you may simply invoke:
> 
> ```bash
> $ chmod 0755 graph-composer.phar
> $ sudo mv graph-composer.phar /usr/local/bin/graph-composer`
> ```
>
> You can verify everything works by running:
> 
> ```bash
> $ graph-composer --version
> ```

#### Updating phar

There's no separate `update` procedure, simply overwrite the existing phar with the new version downloaded.

> Note: [Ticket #1](https://github.com/clue/graph-composer/issues/1) will introduce a `self-update` command eventually.

### Manual Installation from Source

This project requires PHP 5.3+, Composer and GraphViz:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install php5-cli graphviz
$ git clone https://github.com/clue/graph-composer.git
$ cd graph-composer
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```

> If you want to build the above mentioned `graph-composer.phar` yourself, you have
to install [clue/phar-composer](https://github.com/clue/phar-composer#install)
and can simply invoke:
>
> ```bash
> $ php phar-composer.phar build ~/workspace/graph-composer
> ```

#### Updating manually

```bash
$ git pull
$ php composer.phar install
```

### Installation using Composer

This method also requires PHP 5.3+, GraphViz and, of course, Composer.

You may use the `require-dev` section to exclude graph-composer in your production environment.
By using the `dev-master` version you will get the latest (unreleased) version from the git repository, otherwise use a specific [released version](https://github.com/clue/graph-composer/releases).

```
"require-dev": {
    "clue/graph-composer": "dev-master"
}
```

#### Usage

Execute the "binary" in `/vendor/bin/graph-composer`.

E.g. in you ApacheAnt script:

```xml
<target name="graph-composer"
	description="Generate a graphical representation of composer dependencies">
	<exec executable="${basedir}/vendor/bin/graph-composer">
		<arg value="export" />
		<arg value="." />
		<arg value="${basedir}/build/documentation/dependencies.png" />
	</exec>
</target>
```

#### Updating manually

Just run `composer update` if you use the `dev-master` version, otherwise switch to another [released version](https://github.com/clue/graph-composer/releases).
